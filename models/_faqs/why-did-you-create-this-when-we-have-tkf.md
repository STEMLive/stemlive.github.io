title: Why did you create this website when we already have websites for collectives such as <em>The Knowledge Fellowship</em>?
---
We created this website because there are already quite a few STEM streamer collectives out there, such as _The Knowledge Fellowship_, _BrainBytes_ and _Live Coders_, to name but a few, so this website serves to complement, rather than replace, those existing collectives.

We also felt that there wasn't sufficient representation for STEM educators livestreaming on platforms such as Twitch and YouTube that do not belong to, and for that matter do not want to belong to, any of the streamer collectives available for STEM livestreamers.
