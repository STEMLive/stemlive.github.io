<h1>
    About
</h1>

<p>
    {{ site.title }} has been created to showcase the best and brightest of the STEM educators offering high-quality livestream content on digital media platforms including Twitch and YouTube.
</p>

<p>
    We hope that you, the visitor, will benefit greatly from discovering new STEM educators, whether they be technicians or academics, and the regular content that they provide.
</p>

<p>
    Our goal is the promotion of lesser-known STEM content creators that are able to extend their network and can continue to reach a wider audience.
</p>

<p>
    The website's source code is publicly available on GitHub, so that it can be improved upon by the STEM community that has grown thanks to platforms such as Twitch and YouTube.
</p>

<h2 class="h1">
    Who are we?
</h2>

<p>
    {{ site.title }} is the name of not only this website, but also the <a href="{{ site.github_organization }}" target="_blank">GitHub organization</a> responsible for its creation and maintenance.
</p>

<p>
    We are a small group for now, but hope that, given time, this project will resonate within the STEM communities on the livestreaming circuit and we will subsequently increase our numbers.
