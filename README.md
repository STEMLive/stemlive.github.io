# Welcome to STEMLive

This site has been built using the following technologies:

- Jekyll 4
- CSS Grid
- JavaScript (ES6)

You must have both Ruby and Jekyll (and ideally Bundler) installed to set up locally.

## Quickstart (for developers)

1. Run `jekyll serve`
2. Browse to http://localhost:4000/ in a browser of your choice to view your local version of the site.
3. Jekyll is set to autoregenerate by default, so any changes to files you make will trigger the compilation process - so you should be able to view the changes in-browser.

All questions on this project are to be addressed to [enquiries.stemlive@gmail.com](mailto:enquiries.stemlive@gmail.com).
